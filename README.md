# minishell

This project was created with teammate (@tjack at School 21).

The aim of this project is to create simple minishell. Minishell has a history, implementation of some builtin functions (echo, cd, pwd, export, unset, env, exit). 
It works with " and ' commas, ";", ">", "<", ">>" redirections, pipes "|", $? and ctrl-C ctrl-D ctrl-\. Minishell do not support multiline commands.
